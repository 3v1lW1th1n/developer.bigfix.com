This tool parses a bunch of "relevance language report" files. These are files
produced internally by the platform build, and they list all inspectors
available on each platform.

The tool should be run like:

    $ node parse-language-reports LanguageReportFiles

The folder structure of `LanguageReportFiles` is expected to look like:

    8.0.584.0/
      Language.Console_WebReports.txt
      Language.i386_rhe3.txt
      Language.sparc_sol9.txt
      Language.windows.txt
      ...
    8.0.627.0/
      Language.Console_WebReports.txt
      Language.i386_suse80.txt
      Language.ppc_aix51.txt
      Language.x86_64_rhe5.txt
      Language.x86_64_sles9.txt
      ...

If all of the language reports are parsed successfully, a JSON object
representing the combined types and properties in all of the files is output.
