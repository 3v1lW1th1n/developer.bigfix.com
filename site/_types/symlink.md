Symlinks, or symbolic links, are the Unix version of shortcut files (pointers to other files). inspectors can analyze the file objects (files and folders) that symlinks point to by using the standard file inspectors. The symlink inspectors, on the other hand, allow you to analyze the properties of a symlink itself, not just the underlying file. There are many properties that symlinks have in common with files, such as name, pathname, parent folder, and more. In addition, a symlink has a value corresponding to the file object it points to. You can also determine if the file is available or not.
