The <firewall open port> inspectors provide access to the properties of a port that has been opened in the Windows Firewall. These properties correspond to the INetFwOpenPort interface in the Windows Firewall API. The Windows Firewall is supported on Windows XP SP2. For more information, search for 'Windows Firewall API' at the msdn site (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/).
