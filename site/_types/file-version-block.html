You can inspect the version blocks of a file. There may be several language-specific version blocks. Version blocks contain version and name information in a human readable form for the specified language. This is the information that Windows displays in the file properties dialog. This technique uses string values and has a limited array of comparators. For better speed, utility and compactness see the version object.
