Processes allocate the various resources needed to execute a program. Processes have a process identifier, a virtual address space, associated code, a priority class, security settings, environment variables, min and max working set sizes, and at least one executing thread. Processes are typically started with a single primary thread which in turn can spawn additional threads.
