Strings are typically core objects, but some string inspectors may be client-specific. Note: A string literal is written within double quotes. Special characters must be inserted by using the percent sign followed by 2 hex digits. Special characters include those characters with ASCII codes less than the 'space' character (hex 20) or greater than 'tilde' character (hex 7f) as well as the percent character itself (25 hex). For example, to create a string containing a null character and a percent character use "a null is %00, the percent itself is %25". Conversion to upper and lower case is also provided. String works in combination with the string position and substring data types. A string position is a point within a string. It can be compared to an integer, but it also acts as a pointer within a string so that the preceding and following text can be extracted. A substring is a part of a larger string. All operations allowed on a string can be performed on a substring. There are two substrings "be" in the string "To be or not to be". The substrings only differ in their positions within the string.
