The <floating point> type holds a floating-point number, with precision dependent on the computer. It also keeps track of the IEEE floating-point exceptions raised in a calculation and an estimate of the significance with which the number should be expressed when it is converted to a string. All arithmetic operations are carried out to the full precision of the computer; only conversions to string are affected by the estimated significance.
