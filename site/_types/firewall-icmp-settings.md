The <firewall icmp settings> inspectors provide access to the settings controlling Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets. These properties correspond to the INetFwIcmpSettings interface in the Windows Firewall API. The Windows Firewall is supported on Windows XP SP2. For more information, search for 'Windows Firewall API' at the msdn site (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/).
