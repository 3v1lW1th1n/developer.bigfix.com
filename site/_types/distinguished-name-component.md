The <distinguished name component> inspectors refer to the various components of the distinguished name (DN) as defined by the Microsoft Active Directory API. A DN is a sequence of relative distinguished names (RDN) connected by commas. An RDN is an attribute with an associated value in the form attribute=value; normally expressed in a UTF-8 string format. For more information, see the MSDN article on Distinguished Names.
