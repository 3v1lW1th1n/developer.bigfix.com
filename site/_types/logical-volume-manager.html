On AIX, the logical volume manager provides a flexible means of allocating disk space using volume groups, logical volumes, and physical volumes. A volume group is a collection of one or more physical volumes and a logical volume is an abstraction representing a pool of disk space. The disk space assigned to a logical volume appears contiguous to the user, but it may actually be distributed across one or more physical volumes within a single volume group.
