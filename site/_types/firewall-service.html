The <firewall service> inspectors provide access to the properties of a service that may be authorized to listen through the firewall. These properties correspond to the INetFwService interface in the Windows Firewall API. The Windows Firewall is supported on Windows XP SP2. For more information, search for 'Windows Firewall API' at the msdn site (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/).
