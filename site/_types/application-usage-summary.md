To enable the <application usage summary> inspectors, you first need to create the client setting _BESClient_UsageManager_EnableAppUsageSummary and initialize it to 1. You must also configure the set of applications to monitor by creating the client setting _BESClient_UsageManager_EnableAppUsageSummaryApps and initializing it to a list of apps to include (or exclude). The value of this setting should look like +:app1:app2:app3: to add apps to the scope, and -:app1:app2: to exclude apps. The case is ignored. For instance, to only track summary usage on the Word application, use the value +:winword.exe:.
