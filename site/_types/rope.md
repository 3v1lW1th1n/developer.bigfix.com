The <rope> object is a way to efficiently concatenate long strings. String literals in the Relevence language are limited to 512 characters, but internally, they can be any length. Ropes provide a technique for concatenating string literals that is memory-efficient. In general, the Fixlet author will not need to worry about ropes, but they are useful for increasing efficiency.
