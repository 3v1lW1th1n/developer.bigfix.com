An Access Control List, or ACL, is a list of security protections that applies to an object. An object can be a file, process, event, or anything else having a security descriptor. An entry in an access control list (ACL) is an access control entry (ACE). These inspectors work by exposing the GetEffectiveRightsFromAcl method, as explained at the MSDN site. Note: Requires Windows XP, Windows 2000 Professional, or Windows NT Workstation 3.1 and later.
