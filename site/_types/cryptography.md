This is a global object that has several properties that expose the state of the cryptography controls. BigFix uses cryptographic functions throughout the BigFix Platform. Every time an operator logs in to BigFix, creates a new user, starts an action or subscribes to new content, authentication and signature routines are executed using cryptographic libraries based on the FIPS 140-2 standard.
