Format inspectors make it easier for content authors to create localizable content. Similar in concept to the C printf function, they allow you to embed arguments into a formatting string, which is followed by the argument values themselves. The arguments are numbered and enclosed in curly brackets {0} and the values to be substituted are preceded by a plus sign (+). For example:Q: format "At {1}, user {0} is logged on." + name of current user + nowA: At 9/27/2010 3:03:26 PM, user Scott is logged on.
