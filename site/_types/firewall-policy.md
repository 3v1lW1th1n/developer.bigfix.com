The <firewall policy> inspectors provide access to the local, current, domain and standard firewall policies. These properties correspond to the INetFwPolicy interface in the Windows Firewall API. The Windows Firewall is supported on Windows XP SP2. For more information, search for 'Windows Firewall API' at the msdn site (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/).
