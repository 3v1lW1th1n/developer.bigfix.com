In general, the network ip interface object holds locally determined properties of logical network devices configured on the computer. On the Mac, these correspond to interfaces of type AF_INET. The properties that are available depend on the socket support installed on the computer. For Windows computers with winsock 2 support installed, for instance, the information is obtained by an ioctl call and includes Interface address, Interface broadcast address, Interface network mask, Broadcast support flag, Multicast support flag, Loopback interface flag and Point to point interface flag.
