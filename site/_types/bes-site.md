The site inspectors return the names and IDs of the specified site objects. As of BES 7.0, the BES custom site type has been merged with BES site, which now represents all supported types, including external sites, master action sites, operator sites, and custom sites. All properties of BES custom site are now accessible via BES site. As a compatibility measure, BES sites still returns only external and master action sites.
