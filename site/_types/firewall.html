The Firewall inspectors allow you to view the settings of the Windows Firewall on Windows Clients. By inspecting the firewall properties, you can determine which applications have access to unsolicited traffic and how the firewall is configured for various subsets of your network. The Windows Firewall is supported on Windows XP SP2. For more information, search for 'Windows Firewall API' at the MSDN site (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/).
