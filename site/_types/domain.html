Mac OS X defines several file system domains to control access to system resources on multi-user systems. These include the User, Local, Network, Classic and System domains. The domain for a given resource or folder determines its accessibility to the user. For example, while a user-installed font is only available to that user, an administrator-installed font is available to all network users. These inspectors allow folder access to be parceled out according to domain.Note: The "user domain" refers to the root user, not the currently logged in user.
