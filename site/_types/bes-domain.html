BES Domains are collections of sites that constitute a product, such as Patch Management. In the BES Console, domains are represented as the high-level buttons on the left side of the screen. Listing the domains for the Console yields all the currently loaded domains. In Web Reports, only those domains with at least one visible report are listed.
