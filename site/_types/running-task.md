This group of inspectors is built on top of the Windows Task Scheduler (see the MSDN reference). They only work with the 2.0 interface (Win 7, Vista and Server 2008). The scheduler allows tasks to be run according to various criteria. These inspectors provide information such as the name and action(s) of each running task.These inspectors are for the 2.0 interface only.
