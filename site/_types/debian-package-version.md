For Tivoli inspectors, a Debian package is considered to include both the package and the version. This allows the inspectors to home in on specific versioned packages and not just the package itself, which may have numerous versions. These version inspectors return just the version(s) of a given Debian package. A version is composed of three parts: an epoch, an upstream_version and a debian_revision.
