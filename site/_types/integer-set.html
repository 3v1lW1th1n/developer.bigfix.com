The <integer set> inspectors deal with sets of integers, which are essentially lists or arrays with integer elements. Think of them as mathematical sets: you can compare them, subtract them from other sets and form the union and intersection of multiple sets.Note: These inspectors are not available on SUSE Linux systems.
