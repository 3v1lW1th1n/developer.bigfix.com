# type: ipv4 address

This is an Internet Protocol address, version 4. IP addresses are composed of four single-byte integers separated by periods, such as &quot;192.5.0.7&quot;. Note: Prior to version 8.0 of BigFix, this was not a derived type.

# extrema of &lt;ipv4 address&gt;

Returns the minimum and maximum extreme values of the given list of &lt;ipv4 address&gt; types.

# maximum of &lt;ipv4 address&gt;

Returns the maximum value from a list of &lt;ipv4 address&gt; types.

# minimum of &lt;ipv4 address&gt;

Returns the minimum value from a list of &lt;ipv4 address&gt; types.

# unique value of &lt;ipv4 address&gt;

Returns the unique values of a given list of &lt;ipv4 address&gt; types, removing duplicates and sorting by value.

# &lt;ipv4 address&gt; as ipv4or6 address

Converts an IPv4 address into the more inclusive ipv4or6 type.

# &lt;ipv4 address&gt; as ipv6 address

Returns the specified IPv4 address embedded in a IPv6 address space as defined by RFC 4291 section 2.5.5.2: IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address. In this scheme the lowest 32 bits of the IPv6 address contain the IPv4 address, the next higher 16 bits are all 1 (ffff) and the remaining bits are all 0.

# &lt;ipv4 address&gt; as string

Converts the ipv4 address to a string.
