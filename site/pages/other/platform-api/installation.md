title: Installing the Server API
---

After you successfully install IBM BigFix, follow these steps to install the Server API on a Windows system:
1. Download the BES-ServerAPI program from the same IBM site where you
downloaded the IBM BigFix program. It has a name of the form:
BigFix-BES-ServerAPI-9.5.xxx.0.exe. The numbers in the name correspond to
the version. This version must match the version of IBM BigFix that you want
to access with the API.
2. After you download it, run the program. The installer window opens.
3. Click **Next**. In the destination folder dialog you can select in which path 
you want to install the Server API.
4. Click **Next** and then **Install** to start the installation. The installer creates 
a folder named BES Server API, typically in the BigFix Enterprise folder. 
In this folder are the API DLLs you need to access the platform.
5. When the installation completes, click **Finish** to exit the installation wizard. 
6. Reboot the server.
