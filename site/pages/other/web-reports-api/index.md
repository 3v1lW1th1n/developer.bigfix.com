title: The WEB Reports API
---

The Web Reports API allows you to extract data from the Web Reports DB. and to author 
your own Web Reports, granting you the power to create customized views into whatever 
aspect of your network that you want to monitor. 

It is based on the [Dashboard API](../dashboard-api/) , but it operates with static 
web-facing views of your data. These views have a file extension of *BESWRPT*.

This is a sample output of a custom report generated using the Web Reports API:
