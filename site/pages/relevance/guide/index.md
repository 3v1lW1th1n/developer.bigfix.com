The relevance guides on this site provide you with self-lead training on the relevance language.

It is divided into three different parts:

* Click [Core Inspectors](/relevance/guide/basics/) to access the syntax and constructs of the inspectors that are common to both languages.
* Click [Client Relevance](/relevance/guide/client/) to access the part dedicated to the Client Relevance Inspectors.
* Click [Session Relevance](/relevance/guide/session/) to access the part dedicated to the Session Relevance Inspectors.

**Note:** To follow along with these guides and with the [Tutorial](/relevance/tutorial.html), download and use either the [Fixlet Debugger](../../tools/fixlet_debugger.html) for Windows platforms or the [QnA](../../tools/qna.html) for other platforms.
