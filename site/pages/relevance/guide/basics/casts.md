Values can be converted into other types, making it easy to create, concatenate and combine inspectors into complex expressions.

We can convert strings into integers:

{% qna %}
Q: "500" as integer
A: 500
{% endqna %}

We can use the converted integers in math:

{% qna %}
Q: ("500" as integer) * 5
A: 2500
{% endqna %}

We can convert integers to strings:

{% qna %}
Q: 500 as string
A: 500
{% endqna %}

... and we can use concatenate to add text to our integers that we converted to strings:

{% qna %}
Q: 500 as string & " hertz"
A: 500 hertz
{% endqna %}

We can work with dates:

{% qna %}
Q: "01 Apr 2020" as date
A: Wed, 01 Apr 2020
{% endqna %}

We can turn the number of a month back into the name of the month:

{% qna %}
Q: 5 as month
A: May
{% endqna %}

... and shorten the name of the month to its 3 or 4 letter abbreviation:

{% qna %}
Q: january as three letters
A: Jan
{% endqna %}


{% note %}
The Relevance Debugger casts values to strings in order to print them. If an
object does not result in a string, the debugger uses the `as string` method of
the object to turn it into a string. If the object canâ€™t be cast as a string, an
error message is displayed.
