title: UTF-8 String Inspectors
---

UTF-8 (8-bit Unicode Transformation Format) is a variable-length character encoding format. 
It can represent all the characters in the Unicode standard, but it remains backward-compatible with ASCII. 
These Inspectors are specifically designed for the EvaluateRelevance API as used by BES Wizards.
