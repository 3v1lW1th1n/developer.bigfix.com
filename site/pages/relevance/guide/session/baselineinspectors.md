title: Baseline Inspectors

Use these Inspectors to retrieve information about deployed baselines.

## BES Baseline

This Inspector iterates over all of the Baseline objects. It is equivalent to: 

```relevance
bes fixlets whose ( baseline flag of it )".
```

## BES Baseline Component

These Inspectors return the individual components of a Baseline, such as Fixlets, Tasks or other Baselines.

---

## BES Baseline Component Group

Baselines provide a method of grouping Actions from multiple Fixlets, Tasks, or other Baselines. 
Once a Baseline is defined (in the BES Console) the Actions are all grouped for simulataneous application. 
This technique allows you to form natural groupings of Actions for a single-click deployment.
