## BES Baseline Component Group

Baselines provide a method of grouping Actions from multiple Fixlets, Tasks, or other Baselines. 
Once a Baseline is defined (in the BES Console) the Actions are all grouped for simulataneous application. 
This technique allows you to form natural groupings of Actions for a single-click deployment.
