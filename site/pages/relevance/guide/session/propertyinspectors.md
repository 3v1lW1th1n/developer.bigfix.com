title: Property Inspectors

Use these Inspectors to query information about the properties of BES Client computers.

## BES Property

Each client might have several properties that can be examined using these Inspectors.
Properties, along with their names, IDs and definitions, can be iterated to produce property lists of all your networked BES computers.

```

Returns a list of the BES Properties than are currently using disk space.

```relevance
size of (set of bes properties)
```

Returns the current number of BES properties.

## BES Property Set

These Inspectors iterate over the current set of BES properties and package them as a mathematical set, suitable for further set manipulation.

## BES Property with Multiplicity

These Inspectors handle arrays of BES properties, allowing you to extract unique properties and count them.
This object type is derived from the `<bes property>` type and therefore shares the same properties as that type.
