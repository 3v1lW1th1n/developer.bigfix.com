## BES Action with Multiplicity

These Inspectors handle arrays of BES actions, allowing you to extract unique actions and count them.
This object type is derived from the `<bes action>` type and therefore shares the same properties as that type.

## BES Action Status

These Inspectors return information about the status of BES actions, such as whether it is running, evaluating, expired, and more.
The status returned from a BES Action can be cast into a string format to give the text shown in the console. This can be compared for equality using the following constants:
- bes action status fixed 
- bes action status running 
- bes action status evaluating 
- bes action status failed 
- bes action status user cancelled 
- bes action status download failed 
- bes action status locked 
- bes action status waiting 
- bes action status pending downloads 
- bes action status pending restart 
- bes action status pending message 
- bes action status pending login 
- bes action status constrained 
- bes action status expired 
- bes action status postponed 
- bes action status invalid signature 
- bes action status error 
- bes action status not relevant 
- bes action status not reported

## BES Action Parameter

A Fixlet can incorporate parameters into its associated Action. 
When the Fixlet becomes relevant to the network, the BES Console will prompt the user for the value of the parameter. 
For example, a Fixlet Action might need to start a Windows service specified by the Console user. 
When the Action is taken, the Console prompts for the name of the service. 
That value is then passed down to the BES Client and substituted in the local Action script when the script runs.

Click [here](/relevance/reference/bes-action-parameter.html) to access the page describing these inspectors.

**Examples**

```relevance
names of parameters of bes action whose (name of it contains "Download")
```

Returns the parameter names of BES Actions with `"Download"` in the name.

---

## BES Action Result

These Inspectors examine the results of BES Actions, which can be used to make reports.

```relevance
detailed status of result from (bes computer whose (id of it is 1234567)) of (bes action whose (id of it is 1234))
```

Returns the detailed status of the specified action on the given computer.
