title: Site Inspectors
---

Use these Inspectors to query the properties of Fixlet sites to which the client is subscribed.

---

## BES Site

The site Inspectors return the names and IDs of the specified site objects.
The BES site represents all supported types, including external sites, master action sites, operator sites, and custom sites. 
As a compatibility measure, BES sites still returns only external and master action sites.

## BES Site with Multiplicity

These Inspectors deal with arrays of BES sites, allowing you to extract unique properties and count them.
This object type is derived from the <bes site> type and therefore shares the same properties as that type.
