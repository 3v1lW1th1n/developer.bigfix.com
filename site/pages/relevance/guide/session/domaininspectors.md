Use these Inspectors to manage BigFix domains. Domains are collections of sites that constitute a product, such as Patch Management.

## BES Domain

In the BES Console, domains are represented as the high-level buttons on the left side of the screen. 
Listing the domains for the Console yields all the currently loaded domains. 
In Web Reports, only those domains with at least one visible report are listed.

## BES Domain with Multiplicity

These Inspectors deal with sets of BES Domains, allowing you to extract unique domains and count them.
This object type is derived from the <bes domain> type and therefore shares the same properties as that type.
