# type: application usage summary

To enable the `application usage summary` inspectors, you first need to create the client setting `_BESClient_UsageManager_EnableAppUsageSummary` and initialize it to `"1"`. You must also configure the set of applications to monitor by creating the client setting `_BESClient_UsageManager_EnableAppUsageSummaryApps` and initializing it to a list of applications to include or exclude.

The value of this setting should look like `+:app1:app2:app3:` to add applications to the scope, and `-:app1:app2:` to exclude applications. The case is ignored. For instance, to only track summary usage on the Word application, use the value `+:winword.exe:`.
