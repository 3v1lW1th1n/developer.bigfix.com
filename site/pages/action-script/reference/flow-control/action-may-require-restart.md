title: action may require restart
---

This command looks at the system for signs that a restart is needed. If it seems
that a restart is needed, the action completion status will be set to *Pending
Restart* until a restart occurs.

If the optional `name` argument is given and a restart is needed, then the
client will mark `name` as needing a restart. The [pending
restart](/relevance/reference/string.html#pending-restart-string-boolean)
inspector can then be used to see which actions require a restart.

## Syntax

    action may require restart [name]

## Examples

This command is commonly used with patches from Windows Update that might
require a restart. For example:
