title: regset64
---

This command uses the same syntax as the [regset](./regset.html) command, but
places a call to [Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-
us/library/windows/desktop/aa365743%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) before launching the
64-bit version of `regedit.exe` to edit the registry. This allows you to use the
native 64-bit registry to set a registry key to the given name and value.

If the key doesn't already exist, this command creates the key with this initial
value.

## Syntax

    regset64 <key> <name>=<value>

## Examples

Set the `Level` value of the specified registry key to the `DWORD` 2:

```actionscript
regset64 "[HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Word\Security]" "Level"=dword:00000002
```

Set the `testString` value of the specified registry key to `bob`.

```actionscript
regset64 "[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\BigFix Inc.]" "testString"="bob"
```

Clear the data of the specified registry value. 

```actionscript
regset64 "[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ShellScrap]" "AlwaysShowExt"=""
```

## Notes

This command is Windows-only. It will cause an action script to terminate on a
Unix agent.

Notice in these examples that square brackets `[]` are used to enclose the name
of the registry key. Again, this is in keeping with the rules for `REGEDIT4`
registry files.

When you use the `regset64` command, keep in mind that the BigFix client
dynamically builds the `.reg` file that you would have had to create manually to
update the registry and then it executes that resulting `.reg` file for you. One
of the rules of the `.reg` file is that any back slashes `\` in the value field
need to appear as double slashes `\\`.

For example, if you were trying to assign the value `SourcePath2` of the
registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Example`
to `C:\I386`, the command that you would define would look like this:

```actionscript
regset64 "[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Example]" "SourcePath2"="C:\\I386"
```

Alternatively, you could use the [escape](/relevance/reference/string.html#escape-of-string-string) relevance inspector:

```actionscript
regset64 "[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Example]" "SourcePath2"={escape of "c:\I386"}
```

In situations where you need to issue many `regset64` commands, you might
consider using the [appendfile](../file/appendfile.html) or
[createfile until](../file/createfile-until.html) commands to build a properly
formatted regedit file, and then run `regedit` silently:

```actionscript
createfile until end-reg-edit-commands
REGEDIT4
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion]
"SourcePath1"="c:\\I386"
"SourcePath2"="{escapes of pathname of windows folder}"
end-reg-edit-commands
move __createfile setup.reg
wait regedit /s setup.reg
```

If the specified key doesn't already exist, it will be created by this command.
