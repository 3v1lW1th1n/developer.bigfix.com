title: action log command
---

This command tells the client to only log the commands of the action. The
parameters of the commands in the action will not be logged.

Ordinarily all aspects of an action are logged, including commands and
parameters. The parameters may contain information about establishing private
keys or decrypting passwords. This command can be used to avoid logging such
sensitive information.
