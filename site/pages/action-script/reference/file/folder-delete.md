## Syntax

    folder delete <path>

## Examples

Delete the directory `C:\test`.

```actionscript
folder delete "C:\test"
```

Remove the folder `/temp/ハロー` in UTF-8 encoding.

```actionscript
binary name folder delete {("/temp/" as binary_string as hexadecimal) & "e3838fe383ade383bc"}
```

## Notes

It’s good practice to enclose file paths in quotes to preserve spaces. Without
quotes, the file system will not be able to access files with spaces in the path
or file name.
