    folder create <path>

## Examples

Create the `C:\test` folder.

```

Under the current folder create folder "ハロ" in UTF-8 encoding.

```actionscript

```

## Notes

It’s good practice to enclose file paths in quotes to preserve spaces. Without
quotes, the file system will not be able to access files with spaces in the path
or file name.
