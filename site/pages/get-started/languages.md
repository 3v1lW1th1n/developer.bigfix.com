BigFix provides you with proprietary querying and scripting languages that you can use to retrieve and manipulate information or for running commands on client systems. 

<dl>
  <dt>The [Client Relevance Language](../relevance/documentation/guide/client)</dt>
  <dd>Use it to interrogate locally the client system to retrieve information. The information retrieved can combined and correlated with other information in a Boolean expression to determine applicability relevance and success criteria. It can be used also to run analysis, to substitute variables in action scripts, and to generate automatic computer groups. </dd>
  
  <dt>The [Session Relevance Language](../relevance/guide/session)</dt>
  <dd>Use it to retrieve information from the BigFix database. The information retrieved can be displayed in custom dashboards or web reports, or used to integrate with external applications.</dd>
  
  <dt>The [Action Script Language](../action/)</dt>
  <dd>Use it to run commands, named *actions*, from within Fixlets and Tasks on relevant clients. These actions, run in sequence, fix the problem identified by the Applicability Relevance clause.</dd>
