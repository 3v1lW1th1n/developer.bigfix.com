# Who Can Manage Custom Content

{% section %}

The generic term **content** can represent:

* Data to distribute to targets.
* Instructions or queries to run on targets.
* Information retrieved from targets.

After you install the BigFix platform for the first time and, whenever you buy a license for a new BigFix 
application, you subscribe to external content sites. From that moment on, the content is periodically downloaded 
from those external content sites to your database and displayed on the console for use.

You can decide to use these contents available by default from the external content sites, or you can decide 
to create your custom BigFix implementation by *copying and editing existing contents* or creating new 
contents from scratch.

For example, if you want to manage a proprietary application through BigFix, you create custom contents 
to deploy, manage and monitor it.

In general the content gathered from external content sites consists of [fixlets](/get-started/custom-content/fixlet-structure.html), 
[tasks](/get-started/custom-content/task-structure.html), [analyses](/get-started/custom-content/analysis-structure.html), [baselines](/get-started/custom-content/baseline-structure.html), and dashboards. Click the content type to learn about its structure and the parts of it that you can customize.

## Who can create custom content?

Custom content can be created by:

* Master operators (MO).
* Non-master operators (NMO) authorized by a master operator using the [Custom Content](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6MER_9.2.0/com.ibm.tivoli.tem.doc_9.2/Platform/Console/Dialogs/console_operator_details_tab.html) attribute.

{% section %}

## Where the custom content is stored?

By default the custom content is saved to **All contents** domain in one of the following sites:

* Master Action site, which is the default for the master operator.
* That specific operator's site, which is the default for non-master operators.
* A Custom site, for master operators and for non-master operators that were authorized to access the site with write permission by the master operator.

As a best practice, avoid saving new content to *All contents* domain, if it makes sense, save it to the domain in which that custom content will be used.

{% endsection %}


# Who can access my custom content?

The list of operators that can access a custom content depends on the site where that custom content is stored.

* Custom content stored in the Master Action site can be accessed by all master operators.
* Custom content stored in a specific operator site can be accessed by that operator and by all master operators.
* Custom content stored in a Custom site can be accessed by all the operators that are allowed by a master operator in the Custom site definition.
