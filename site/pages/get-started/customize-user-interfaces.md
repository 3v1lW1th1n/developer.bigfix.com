---

The following graphic shows sample customizations that you can do to implement
your custom user interface, and the language and APIs involved.

![Customize Interfaces](/static/img/customize-interfaces.png)

The language highlighted in the graphic, the Session Relevance Language, extracts 
data previously collected on the clients and currently stored in the BigFix database.
The APIs use the data extracted by the Session Relevance queries.

Click [Relevance](/relevance/) to access the information about the relevance 
language and navigate the content about Session Relevance Language and Core 
Inspectors.

Click [Presentation Debugger](/relevance/tools/presentation_debugger.html) to access 
a tool useful to develop and test your session relevance queries.

Click [Other APIs](/other/) to access the documentation about the dashboard API and the Web Reports API.

<!--- Select [Use Case Scenarios](/use-cases/) in the main toolbar and then the name
of the scenario listed in the graphic to see the steps to run to implement it. --->
