An analysis is a collection of property expressions that allows an operator to
view and summarize on the console various properties of BigFix client computers
across a network.

This graphic shows the parts of the analysis that you can customize.

For each part in the analysis structure, you see:

* On the right, an explanation of its role within the logic of the analysis.
* On the left, the language to use to create or modify that part. You can access the available information about that specific language by clicking the box or selecting the corresponding entry in the main toolbar.
