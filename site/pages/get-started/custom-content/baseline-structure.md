title: Baseline Structure
---

A baseline is a deployment container of Fixlets and tasks. You can use it to apply a set of contents at the same time to one or more targets. The contents are applied according to the sequence specified in the baseline description.

This graphic shows the parts of the baseline that you can customize.

For each part in the baseline structure, you see:
* On the right, an explanation of its role within the logic of the baseline.
* On the left, the language to use to create or modify that part. You can access the available information about that specific language by clicking the box or selecting the corresponding entry in the main toolbar.
