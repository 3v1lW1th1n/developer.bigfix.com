# Manage Custom Content

The following graphic shows sample customizations that you can do to interact with personalized data 
available on the client system, the BigFix object to use to implement them and the languages involved.

![Manage Custom Content](/static/img/manage-custom-content.png "Manage Custom Content")

The languages highlighted in the graphic operate real time on the client machine and their scope is to inspect 
data, for the client relevance language, and to run commands, for the action script language.

Click [Relevance Language](/relevance/) and [Action Script Language](/action-script/) to access the guides, the 
references and tools, such as the Fixlet Debugger and the interactive sandbox that you can use to develop and test your 
custom solution.

Select [Use Case Scenarios](/use-cases/) in the main toolbar and then the name of the scenario listed in the graphic to 
see the steps to run to implement it.
