title: Fixlet Structure
---

A Fixlet is a document that contains instructions that the BigFix agents use on target computers to assess their status, identify issues, such as a vulnerability or a lack of compliance with a policy rule, and take corrective actions to resolve the issue.

This graphic shows the parts of the Fixlet that you can customize.

For each part in the Fixlet structure, you see:

* On the right, an explanation of its role within the logic of the Fixlet.
* On the left, the language to use to create or modify that part. You can access the available information about that specific language by clicking the box or selecting the corresponding entry in the main toolbar.
