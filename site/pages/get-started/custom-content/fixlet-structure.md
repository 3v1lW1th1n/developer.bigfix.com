title: Customizing Fixlets  
---

A Fixlet is a document that contains instructions that the BigFix agents use on
target computers to assess their status, identify issues, such as a
vulnerability or a lack of compliance with a policy rule, and take corrective
actions to resolve the issue.

This graphic shows the parts of the Fixlet that you can customize.

Click [Relevance](/relevance/) to access the information about the relevance 
language and navigate the content about Client Relevance Language and Core

Action Script Language.

**Note:** You can either create your Fixlet from scratch or make a copy of 
an existing Fixlet document and modify the copy.
