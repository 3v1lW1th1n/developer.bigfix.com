# Get Started

IBM BigFix is a system-management suite of products that allows you to manage heterogeneous environments.

Such environments can be already personalized and can include proprietary data that are not known to the default BigFix solution or external applications that BigFix must interact with. In this case you must let BigFix know that these custom resources exist and instruct BigFix to interact with them.

To help you implementing these costumizations, BigFix provides you with querying and scripting proprietary languages that are platform independent, to a certain extent, and with APIs.

Using these languages and APIs you can:

<dl>
  <dt>**[Manage custom content defined on clients](/get-started/manage-custom-content.html)**</dt>
  <dd>To enforce custom policies, run commands to manage personalized content, collect custom data and display it on the console or in the Web Reports.</dd>

  <dt>**[Customize user interfaces](/get-started/customize-user-interfaces.html)**</dt>
  <dd>To create your personalized interface to implement, for example, your custom dashboards and reports.</dd>

  <dt>**[Integrate with external applications](/get-started/integrate-external-applications.html)**</dt>
  <dd>To interact with proprietary or third parties applications located on the server or on the clients and aggregate data sources for running reports.</dd>
</dl>
