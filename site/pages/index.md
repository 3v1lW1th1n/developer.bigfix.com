Welcome to the IBM BigFix Development site!
===================

Developer.bigfix.com is the official IBM repository of information for developing IBM BigFix content, and is tailored to satisfy the needs of both beginner and expert content developers.
 
This site provides you with information about action scripts, REST API, other APIs, and inspectors, together with an interactive sandbox for relevance experimentation.

> Developer.bigfix.com is a live and collaborative repository based on GitHub open source technology. You are welcome to contribute with your input to enhance the content of this site by using  [pull requests][11].

Depending on your skill level, choose one of these two paths:

**Are you new to IBM BigFix content development?**

> It's time to start writing your own custom content for IBM BigFix!
> First click **Introduction** to learn what you can customize and how. 
> Then access the **Guide** subsections under each of the languages and APIs to learn how to use them. Each topic contains examples, video tutorials, and exercises.

**Are you already familiar with developing IBM BigFix custom content and you know which language or API to use?**

> Navigate the specific language or API section and click:
> **Reference**, to see the syntax and structure of all expressions and commands.  
> **Search**, to find the syntax and the usage of known keys and properties (available for relevance language).

Are you ready to test the relevance expressions that you developed?
Access the **Evaluator** subsection to access the live, interactive sandbox.

If an expression or command fails, check the **Troubleshooting** subsection to see the list of known errors and limitations with possible workarounds.  

Navigate the **Examples** to see real user scenarios implemented using relevance and action script languages and APIs.

To complete your 360-degree view of the IBM BigFix development world:

 - Connect to the BigFix developers community and go through a topic-based list of Q&As in the [forum][13].
 - Share your custom content with other users and download available expressions and structures from [bigfix.me][14].
 - Access the available development tools on [github.com/bigfix][15].
