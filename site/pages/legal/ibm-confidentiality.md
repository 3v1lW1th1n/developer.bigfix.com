title: IBM Confidential Disclosure Agreement
---

<p><strong>By using developer.bigfix.com, you may be subject to
and, if so, will comply with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
relating to IBM disclosures set forth below.
</strong></p>

<p>This Confidentiality Agreement ("Agreement") provides
protection for confidential information ("Information") provided by
International Business Machines Corporation or its affiliates
(together, "IBM") in a community or other component on developer.bigfix.com
("Site"). By accessing and using the Site, you agree the following
terms will apply when IBM discloses Information to you ("Recipient") in
a community or other component.
</p>

<p>This Agreement pertains solely to disclosures by IBM of
Information in a community or other component on the Site. Disclosures
outside of the Site may be subject to additional or other
confidentiality agreements, and this Agreement does not supersede or
otherwise affect any such other confidentiality agreements.
</p>

<p>For five(5) years after the date of disclosure, the Recipient
will: i) use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure of IBM's
Information as the Recipient uses with its own similar information
which it does not wish to disclose; and ii) use IBM's Information only
for the benefit of IBM.
</p>

<p>The Recipient may disclose Information to: i) its employees
and employees of its parent and majority owned affiliates who have a
need to know; and ii) any other party with IBM's prior written consent.
Before disclosure to any of the above parties, the Recipient must have
an appropriate agreement with such party sufficient to require that
party to treat Information in accordance with this Agreement. The
Recipient may disclose Information to the extent required by law, but
must give IBM reasonable prior notice to allow IBM a reasonable
opportunity to obtain a protective order. No obligation under this
Agreement will apply to Information that is: i) already in Recipient's
possession or received by Recipient without a non-disclosure
obligation; ii) developed independently by Recipient; or iii) publicly
available when received, or thereafter becomes publicly available
through no fault of the Recipient.
</p>

<p>This Agreement does not require IBM to disclose Information.
Recipient may not assign or otherwise transfer its rights or delegate
its duties or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of IBM. Only a written agreement signed by both of us
can modify this Agreement. Either of us may terminate this Agreement by
providing one month's written notice to the other. Any provisions of
this Agreement which by their nature extend beyond its termination
remain in effect until fulfilled and apply to our respective successors
and authorized assigns. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the
State of New York. Each party hereby agrees to waive its rights to a
jury trial. This Agreement and the Terms of Use for the Site are the
complete and exclusive agreement regarding our disclosures of
Information on the Site. Neither this Agreement nor any disclosure of
Information hereunder grants the Recipient any right or license under
any trademark, copyright or patent now or hereafter owned or controlled
by IBM. IBM PROVIDES INFORMATION SOLELY ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. </p>

<p>Any information or materials disclosed by Recipient to IBM
will be deemed non-confidential and IBM may use and disclose such
information and materials on an unrestricted basis without notice or
compensation to you. </p>
