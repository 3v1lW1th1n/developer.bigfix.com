title: IEM Command-Line Interface
---

This command-line interface (CLI) is a lightweight wrapper for user authentication, session management, HTTP request and response generation, and parsing. 
A request initiated by the IEM CLI is sent to the REST API for processing.

**Note:** The IEM CLI does not support the BigFix FIPS-compliant cryptography library. If you must use this capability in your REST API HTTP environment, use a different FIPS-capable REST Client application.
