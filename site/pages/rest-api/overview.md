**RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer is a client-server architecture. IBM BigFix provides you with:
- The REST API server part, available on the BigFix server, whose role is to manipulate the objects stored in the BigFix database.
- A lightweight command-line tool named [IEM Command-Line Interface](/rest-api/iem_cli/index.html) (CLI), that you can use as a REST client to initiate requests towards the REST API server.

If you want, you can use your preferred REST Client, in place of the IEM CLI, to issue methods and interact with the BigFix REST server through HTML calls.
