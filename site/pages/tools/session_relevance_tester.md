title: The Session Relevance Tester

{% section %}

Starting the BigFix Console just to access the Presentation Debugger can be inconvenient because the Console takes a while to load. Instead of that approach, you can run the Session Relevance Editor.
These are the main features in the BigFix Session Relevance Tester:

* Session Relevance Editor against the Web Reports context.
* Web Reports Editor to write and run reports.

Click [Session Relevance](/relevance/guide/session/) to access the part dedicated to the Session Relevance language.

It also includes modules such as the Session Relevance Editor module, the Inspector Reference module, and the Web Reports module. which simply returns the values from the Properties inspector. It provides a fast and efficient way to browse through available inspectors and their corresponding creation methods and properties.
