{% type activity history %}

The &lt;activity history&gt; inspectors keep track of the activity of a single logged-on user. You may iterate over all logged-on users and get the history for each user separately. User information is purged at log off and power off/client off, even if the user immediately logs back in. These inspectors retrieve information within a tracking window (defaulting to 14 days) or, if the window is still open, the start of that window. Information is in the form of a list of (interval, state) tuples. The first element of the list is the current state of the system. The event lists are fetched from the client each time &#39;activity history&#39; is referenced, so you should avoid referencing these inspectors more than once in a relevance statement. Note: Activity tracking only works while the Client UI is running. These inspectors only work with Windows 2000 or better.

#### Properties of activity history

{% property user interval of <activity history> %}

Returns a power interval (containing a time range and a power state, such as standby or idle) corresponding to the specified user activity history.

{% type local group %}

#### Properties of local group

{% property comment of <local group> %}

Returns a string containing a comment associated with the specfied local group (Administrator, Guest, Users).Example: comment of local group &quot;Administrators&quot; - Returns the string &quot;Administrators have complete and unrestricted access to the computer/domain&quot;.

{% property member of <local group> %}

Returns a list of the members of the specified local group.

{% type logged on user %}

These Windows and Macintosh inspectors return information about the currently logged-on user. With the advent of Terminal Services and Fast User Switching, these inspectors are designed to iterate over all logged on users. Windows Note: If Terminal Services are available (NT/2000/2003/XP/Vista) and enabled, these inspectors iterate over the active and disconnected sessions as returned by WTSEnumerateSessions. Disconnected sessions are those where a user logs on, but is currently inactive. On Vista, the non-interactive session 0 (used for services isolation) is not included. If Terminal Services aren&#39;t available, the ACLs on the security descriptor of the &quot;winsta0&quot; window station are examined for user logons. On Windows 9x systems, these inspectors return the user session associated with the registry value &quot;Current User&quot; of &quot;SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control&quot; if it exists. Otherwise, if a shell process process such as Explorer.exe is running, they return a single session associated with an unnamed user (which occurs when the user cancels the 9x login dialog).

#### Properties of logged on user

{% property active of <logged on user> %}

Returns TRUE if the specified user session is active (either as a current Fast User or an active terminal services connection).

{% property activity history of <logged on user> %}

Returns the activity history of the specified logged-on user. This.

{% property name of <logged on user> %}

If Terminal Services is available and enabled under NT4/2000/2003/XP/Vista, this inspector returns the result of WTSQuerySessionInformation with WTSUserName. With Terminal Services disabled, it examines the ACLs on the security descriptor of the &quot;winsta0&quot; window station. Under Windows 9x, returns the &quot;Current User&quot; of &quot;SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control&quot; if it exists. Otherwise returns No Such Object.

{% property process id of <logged on user> %}

Returns the process id number for the base session process for logged on users, usually the session manager.

{% property remote of <logged on user> %}

Returns TRUE if the user session is a remote terminal services connection.

{% property session id of <logged on user> %}

Returns the session id, which uniquely identifies a logged on user session. A logged-on user is a subclass of a user, and adding the session id uniquely identifies the session.

{% property sid of <logged on user> %}

Returns the Security ID (SID) of the user associated with the session&#39;s primary access token. With Windows 2003/XP/Vista, this is determined by WTSQueryUserToken. With NT4/2000 it is determined by the apparent shell process running in the given session. This inspector may fail if run in a non-privileged context. The SID does not exist under Windows 9x.

{% property tty of <logged on user> %}

Returns the name of the connection the user is on. Result is platform specific. Examples are: &quot;Console&quot;, &quot;RDP-Tcp#0&quot;, &quot;pts/1&quot;, &quot;:0&quot;

{% property user key of <logged on user> %}

Returns the registry key of the specified logged on user

{% property user of <logged on user> %}
