The &lt;bes action with multiplicity&gt; inspectors deal with arrays of BES Actions, allowing you to extract unique actions and count them.

#### Properties

{% property multiplicity of <bes action with multiplicity> %}

Sorts the list and returns the multiplicity, or count, of each unique element in the specified list of multiple &lt;bes action&gt; types.

{% type bes action status%}

The &lt;bes action status&gt; inspectors return information about the status of BES Actions, such as whether it is running, evaluating, expired, and more.

#### Casts

{% property <bes action status> as string %}

Casts an action status as a string.

{% type bes action set%}

The &lt;bes action set&gt; inspectors return the iterated list of BES Actions, converted into a set to make it easy to do set arithmetic with the list.

#### Casts

{% property <bes action set> as xml %}
