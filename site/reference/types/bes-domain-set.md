Returns the unique elements of the specified &lt;bes domain set&gt;, removing duplicates and sorting by value.

# intersection of &lt;bes domain set&gt;

Returns the number of unique elements in the specified set of BES domains.

# union of &lt;bes domain set&gt;

Produces a new set of BES domains containing the union of the specified sets.
