# type: debian base package

For Tivoli inspectors, a Debian package is considered to include both the package and the version. This allows the inspectors to home in on specific versioned packages and not just the package itself, which may have numerous versions. The base package inspectors help to tease these two aspects apart, stripping the version info and returning a list of the packages by name only.
