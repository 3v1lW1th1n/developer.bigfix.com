# file version block

You can inspect the version blocks of a file. There may be several language-specific version blocks. Version blocks contain version and name information in a human readable form for the specified language. This is the information that Windows displays in the file properties dialog. This technique uses string values and has a limited array of comparators. For better speed, utility and compactness see the version object.

# codepage of <file version block>

A string representation of the codepage portion of the id of this version block. See notes for known codepage strings. For example, &#39;Unicode&#39;.Example: codepage of only version block of regapp &quot;bigfix.exe&quot; is &quot;Unicode&quot; - Returns `True` if the version block codepage for the specified file is unicode.

# id of <file version block>

A string representation containing both the language and codepage of this version block. The format is 8 hex digits, 4 of the codepage concatenated with 4 of the language. For example, &#39;040904b0&#39;. See notes for known values.Example: id of only version block of regapp &quot;bigfix.exe&quot; is &quot;040904b0&quot; - Returns `True` if the given file&#39;s version block id is the specified string.

# language of <file version block>

A string representation of the language portion of the id of this version block. For example, &#39;English (United States)&#39;. See notes for known values.Example: language of version block 1 of regapp &quot;bigfix.exe&quot; = &quot;English (United States)&quot; - Returns `True` if the given file&#39;s version block language is as specified.

# value <string> of <file version block>

Returns a string corresponding to the name provided. Values have names such as &#39;CompanyName&#39;, &#39;FileDescription&#39;, &#39;FileVersion&#39;.Example: value &quot;FileVersion&quot; of version block 1 of regapp &quot;bigfix.exe&quot; as version - When casting a string value to a version, the parser skips through the string until it identifies something that can be interpreted as a version. This is convenient for extracting version numbers from strings containing added text.
