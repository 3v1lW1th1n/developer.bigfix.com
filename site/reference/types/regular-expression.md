# type: regular expression

The &amp;lt;regular expression&amp;gt; inspectors let you use regular expressions (or regexes) in relevance statements. They use the boost library implementation of the &amp;#39;POSIX-Extended&amp;#39; regular expression syntax, as documented at Wikipedia using the search term &amp;quot;posix-extended regex&amp;quot;.
