# task idle settings

The &lt;task idle settings&gt; objects specify how the Task Scheduler performs tasks when the computer is in an idle condition. These settings concern the duration, restart, stop and wait conditions for the specified idle settings. For more information about idle conditions, see &#39;Task Idle Conditions&#39; at MSDN.

# stop on idle end of <task idle settings>

Returns a Boolean value that indicates that the Task Scheduler will terminate the task if the idle condition ends before the task is completed.

# wait timeout of <task idle settings>
