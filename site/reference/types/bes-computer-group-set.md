Returns the unique elements of the specified &lt;bes computer group set&gt;, removing duplicates and sorting by value.

# intersection of &lt;bes computer group set&gt;

# size of &lt;bes computer group set&gt;

Returns the number of unique BES Computer Groups in the specified set.

# union of &lt;bes computer group set&gt;

Returns the union of multiple BES computer group sets. The arguments to this inspector are typically plural values or iterations, but you can also compose such a set by separating singlet values with semicolons.
