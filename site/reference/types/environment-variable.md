# environment variable

Every variable defined by the environment has both a name and a value. Both names and values are treated as strings.

# name of [environment variable]

Returns the name of the variable.

# value of [environment variable]

Returns the value of the variable.

# [environment variable] as string

Casting the variable as a string yields a string containing the variable name and the value of the variable separated by &#39; = &#39;.
