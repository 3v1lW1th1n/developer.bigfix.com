# type: registry key

The &amp;lt;registry key&amp;gt; objects represent Windows registry keys whose existence and properties can be inspected. Keys can be identified by name. There are several inspectors that return keys from parts of the registry that store file associations and active device drivers.

Returns the application associated with the named command. Normally used with a sub-key of key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT whose name is a file type.

# application folder &lt;string&gt; of &lt;registry key&gt; : folder

Returns the parent folder associated with the named application. Normally used with a sub-key of key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT whose name is a file type.

# application folder of &lt;registry key&gt; : folder

Returns the parent folder associated with the named application. Normally used with a sub-key of key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT whose name is a file type.
