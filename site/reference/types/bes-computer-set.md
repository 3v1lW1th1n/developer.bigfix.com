# bes computer set

The &lt;bes computer set&gt; inspectors convert an iterated list of computers into a set, which allows you to perform intersections, unions and other mathematical operations on them.

# element of <bes computer set>

Returns the unique elements of the specified &lt;bes computer set&gt;, removing duplicates and sorting by value.

# intersection of <bes computer set>

Returns the intersection of multiple BES computer sets. The arguments to this inspector are typically plural values or iterations, but you can also compose such a set by separating singlet values with semicolons.

# size of <bes computer set>

Returns the number of unique BES Computers in the specified set.

# union of <bes computer set>

Returns the union of multiple BES computer sets. The arguments to this inspector are typically plural values or iterations, but you can also compose such a set by separating singlet values with semicolons.
