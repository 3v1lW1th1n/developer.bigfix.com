# type: monthly task trigger

The &amp;lt;monthly task trigger&amp;gt; inspectors deal with tasks that are triggered on a monthly basis. For example, a task might start at 9:00 AM on specific days of specific months. More information about this subset of task triggers can be found by searching for Monthly Trigger at the MSDN site.

# months run of &lt;monthly task trigger&gt; : month

Returns  the months of the year during which the task will run.

# random delay of &lt;monthly task trigger&gt; : time interval
