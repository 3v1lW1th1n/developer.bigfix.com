# monitor power interval

The &lt;monitor power interval&gt; inspectors return information about the monitors (displays) attached to a given computer. Each computer can have multiple monitors, and they can be either on or off. This information can be used in a power-usage study. Monitor intervals are retrieved as tuples in the form of &lt;interval, state, monitor count&gt;, where the interval contains the start and end time, the state (on or off) and the number of monitors that are attached to the computer.
