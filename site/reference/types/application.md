# type: application

Application objects derive from file objects. Therefore, application objects inherit all of the properties of the file object. This means that you can inspect properties such as &#39;modification time&#39; or &#39;Product Version&#39; of an application just as you would a file. See the properties of a file object for a complete list of these. The real power and primary purpose of the application object is their creation. The creation methods are optimized in anticipation of the importance of this object.Note: See  File&#39; for a list of the Application properties. Folder and file names may be case sensitive. Use &quot;as uppercase&quot; or &quot;as lowercase&quot; if you don&#39;t know the actual case when making comparisons. For Windows versions of these inspectors, a properly installed application will register itself with the operating system. It does this by creating a registry sub-key usually named after the executable. The regapp inspector uses the default value of this sub-key as a string that is the full pathname of the executable.
