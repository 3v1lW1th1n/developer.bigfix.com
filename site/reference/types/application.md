# type: application

Application objects derive from file objects. Therefore, application objects inherit all of the properties of the file object. This means that you can inspect properties such as &amp;#39;modification time&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Product Version&amp;#39; of an application just as you would a file. See the properties of a file object for a complete list of these. The real power and primary purpose of the application object is their creation. The creation methods are optimized in anticipation of the importance of this object.Note: See  File&amp;#39; for a list of the Application properties. Folder and file names may be case sensitive. Use &amp;quot;as uppercase&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;as lowercase&amp;quot; if you don&amp;#39;t know the actual case when making comparisons. For Windows versions of these inspectors, a properly installed application will register itself with the operating system. It does this by creating a registry sub-key usually named after the executable. The regapp inspector uses the default value of this sub-key as a string that is the full pathname of the executable.
