# bit set

A small, numbered collection of bits that can be examined and manipulated.

# bit [integer] of [bit set]

Returns the value of the bit at the given &lt;integer&gt; position in the set.

# least significant one bit of [bit set]

Returns the least n such that bit n of the set is true.

# left shift [integer] of [bit set]

A bit set which, at each position n &gt;= delta, holds bit n-delta of the original bit set, where delta is the given integer.

# most significant one bit of [bit set]

Returns the greatest n such that bit n of the set is true.

# one bit of [bit set]

Returns the numbers n for which bit n of the set is true.

# padded string of [bit set]

No documentation exists.

# right shift [integer] of [bit set]

A bit set which, at each position n, holds bit n+delta of the original bit set, where delta is the given shift integer.

# [bit set] as integer

Returns the integer whose binary representation matches the bit set.

# [bit set] as string

Returns the bits (0s and 1s) in a string format.
