# time

A &lt;time&gt; object is used to identify a point in time. Time objects are used to represent important properties of objects such as the modification time of a file. You can create time objects from literal strings. The format of the string is defined by the MIME standard. The difference between two Time objects may be calculated by subtracting them and yields time intervals. Time intervals may be added or subtracted from time objects to obtain time objects.
