The &lt;exponential projection&gt; inspectors return statistical correlation information about the logarithms of the aggregated properties.

# correlation coefficient of <exponential projection>

Returns a floating-point number between -1 and 1, representing how well an exponential projection fits the data.

# extrapolation <time> of <exponential projection>

Returns the projected value at the specified time, assuming an exponential projection.

# rate <time interval> of <exponential projection>

Returns the slope of the exponential projection over the specified time interval.
