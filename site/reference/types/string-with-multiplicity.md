# string with multiplicity

The &lt;string with multiplicity&gt; inspectors deal with arrays of strings, allowing you to extract unique strings and count them.

# multiplicity of <string with multiplicity>

Returns the multiplicity (quantity) of each element in a multiple string list.Example: multiplicities of unique values of (&quot;steak&quot;; &quot;chop&quot;; &quot;rib&quot;; &quot;rib&quot;; &quot;rib&quot;) - Returns the multiplicity of (the number of times) each string in the list is used, namely, 1,3,1. Note that the multiplicities are based on the alphabetic order of the strings (chop, rib, steak), not their position in the list.
