# service &lt;string&gt; of &lt;smf&gt; : smf service

Returns the smf service object identified by the specified name. Services have unique names, so this is a singular property. An smf service inspector represents a type of service (such as &amp;#39;web server&amp;#39;) without specifying a particular piece of server software (such as &amp;#39;Apache&amp;#39;).

# service of &lt;smf&gt; : smf service
