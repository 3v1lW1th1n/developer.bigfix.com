# string set

The &lt;string set&gt; inspectors deal with sets of strings, which are essentially lists or arrays with string elements. Think of them as mathematical sets: you can compare them, subtract them from other sets and form the union and intersection of multiple sets.Note: These inspectors are not available on SUSE Linux systems.

# element of <string set>

Returns the unique elements of the specified &lt;string set&gt;, removing duplicates and sorting by value.Example: elements of set of (&quot;beta&quot;;&quot;beta&quot;;&quot;alpha&quot;;&quot;gamma&quot;;&quot;beta&quot;) - Returns the strings alpha, beta, gamma.

# intersection of <string set>

Returns a set of strings equal to the intersection of the specified sets, aphabetized and with redundant elements stripped out.

# size of <string set>

Returns the number of unique elements in the specified set.Example: size of set of (&quot;to&quot;;&quot;be&quot;; &quot;or&quot;; &quot;not&quot;; &quot;to&quot;; &quot;be&quot;) - Returns 4, the number of unique strings in the set.

# union of <string set>

Returns a set of strings equal to the union of the specified sets, alphabetized and with redundant elements stripped out.
