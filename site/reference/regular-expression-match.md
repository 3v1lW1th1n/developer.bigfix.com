# regular expression match

The &lt;regular expression match&gt; inspectors let you match regular expressions (or regexes) in relevance statements. They use the boost library implementation of the &#39;POSIX-Extended&#39; regular expression syntax, as documented at Wikipedia using the search term &quot;posix-extended regex&quot;.

# parenthesized part [integer] of [regular expression match]

Returns the nth parenthetical (given by &lt;integer&gt;) in the specified regular expression match.

# parenthesized part of [regular expression match]

Returns the parenthetical part of the specified regular expression match.
