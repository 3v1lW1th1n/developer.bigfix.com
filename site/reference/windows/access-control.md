{% type system access control list%}

The &lt;system access control list&gt; inspectors retrieve information from the access control list that controls the generation of audit messages for attempts to access a securable object. The ability to get or set an object&#39;s SACL is controlled by a privilege typically held only by system administrators.

{% property <system access control list> as string %}

Converts the specified system access control list (SACL) into a string value in the Microsoft Security Descriptor String Format.

{% type security identifier%}

A Security Identifier, or SID, is a data structure that identifies user, group, and computer accounts. Every account on a network is issued a unique SID when the account is first created. Internal processes in Windows refer to an account&#39;s SID rather than the account&#39;s user or group name.

{% property <security identifier> as string %}

Returns the security identifier in string format.

{% property domain name of <security identifier> %}

Returns the domain name of the first domain on which the specified SID is found.

{% property component string of <security identifier> %}

This Windows-specific inspector returns a string formatted using the ConvertSidToStringSid windows API, discussed at: http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376399(VS.85).aspx.Example: component string of owner of security descriptor of windows folder - Returns a string of the form: S-1-5-32-544.

{% property account name of <security identifier> %}

Retrieves the name of the account for this SID and the name of the first domain on which this SID is found.

{% property user of <security identifier> %}

No documentation exists for this property.

{% type security descriptor%}

The &lt;security descriptor&gt; objects are structures and associated data that contain the security information for a securable object. A security descriptor identifies the object&#39;s owner and primary group. It can also contain a DACL that controls access to the object, and a SACL that controls the logging of attempts to access the object.

{% property <security descriptor> as string %}

Returns the security descriptor in string format.

{% property sacl of <security descriptor> %}

Returns the system access control list (SACL), an ACL that controls the generation of audit messages for attempts to access a securable object.

{% property owner of <security descriptor> %}

Returns the security identifier of the owner of the specified security descriptor.

{% property group of <security descriptor> %}

Returns the security identifier of the group of the specified security descriptor.

{% property dacl of <security descriptor> %}

Returns the discretionary access control list (DACL) that identifies the users and groups who are allowed or denied access to the specified security descriptor.

{% property control of <security descriptor> %}

Returns the integer property obtained by using the Microsoft Windows GetSecurityDescriptorControl API. This integer contains bits that indicate DACL behaviors as well as default behaviors. See the MSDN documentation of SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR_CONTROL for more information.

{% property null sacl of <security descriptor> %}

No documentation exists for this property.

{% property null dacl of <security descriptor> %}

No documentation exists for this property.

{% type security database%}

The &lt;security database&gt; inspectors retrieve information from the security accounts manager (SAM) database or, in the case of domain controllers, the Active Directory. The Security database and its properties expose the NetUserModalsGet API, levels 0 and 3. For more information, see the NetUserModalsGet Function at the MSDN site: http://msdn.microsoft.com.

{% property password history length of <security database> %}

{% property minimum password age of <security database> %}

Returns a time interval corresponding to the minimum password age found in the specified security database.

{% property maximum password age of <security database> %}

Returns a time interval corresponding to the maximum password age found in the specified security database. This will not exist if the password never expires.

{% property force logoff interval of <security database> %}

Returns the time interval between the end of the valid logon time and the time when the user must log off the network. A value of zero indicates that the user must log off immediately as soon as the valid logon time expires. This will not exist if the user is never forced to log off. For more information, see the MSDN article on NetUserModalsGet.

{% property account lockout threshold of <security database> %}

Returns an integer corresponding to the number of invalid password authentications that can occur before an account is marked &#39;locked out.&#39; For more information, see the MSDN article on NetUserModalsGet.

{% property account lockout observation window of <security database> %}

Returns a time interval corresponding to the maximum time that can elapse between any two failed logon attempts before lockout occurs. For more information, see the MSDN article on NetUserModalsGet.

{% property account lockout duration of <security database> %}

Returns the time interval corresponding to how long a locked account remains locked before it is automatically unlocked. This may not exist for locked accounts that remain locked until an administrator unlocks them. For more information, see the MSDN article on NetUserModalsGet.

{% type security account%}

The &lt;security account&gt; type serves as a base type for the &quot;user&quot; and &quot;local group&quot; types and for properties common to users and groups.

{% property sid of <security account> %}

Returns the Security ID (SID) associated with the specified security account.

{% property privilege of <security account> %}
