{% type security identifier %}

A Security Identifier, or SID, is a data structure that identifies user, group, and computer accounts. Every account on a network is issued a unique SID when the account is first created. Internal processes in Windows refer to an account&#39;s SID rather than the account&#39;s user or group name.
