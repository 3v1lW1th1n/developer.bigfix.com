# file

For each file in the file system, you can create a corresponding file object and inspect its properties. inspectors are also provided to look at version data of executable files.Note: File systems that do not maintain the creation or last accessed times will often return the last modification time when queried for the creation or last accessed times or files. Modification times are preserved when files are copied. Thus, it is not uncommon to see a file that appears to have been modified before it was created.
