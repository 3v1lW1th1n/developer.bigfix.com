Snapshots are automatically created and managed by the Service Management Facility. A snapshot consists of a set of snaplevels, each of which holds copies of the property groups associated with an instance or service in the resolution path of the base instance. Typically, there is one snaplevel for the instance and one for the instance&#39;s parent service.

{% property fmri of <smf instance> %}

Returns an smf fmri object representing the &#39;Fault Management Resource Identifier&#39; of a service instance. The FMRI is used to identify a specific instance of a service for administrative use.

{% type smf fmri%}

{% property <smf fmri> as string %}

Returns a string representation of the smf fmri object. The string has the general form &#39;svc:&lt;service name&gt;:&lt;service instance&gt;&#39;. For example &#39;svc:/network/login:rlogin&#39;, where &#39;svc&#39; signifies an SMF service, &#39;/network/login&#39; is the service name, and &#39;rlogin&#39; is the service instance.
