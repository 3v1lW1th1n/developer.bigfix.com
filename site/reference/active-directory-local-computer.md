# active directory local computer

The &lt;active directory local computer&gt; objects are the Active Directory inspectors for the local computer. Caching (using XML files to represent the last data update) limits how often the client refreshes the AD data, reducing network traffic. These inspectors require network access to work. If no network connection is available and the information is not cached, then the inspectors will return NoSuchObject. AD user requests are limited to users that are either cached or have a local profile on the specified machine.
