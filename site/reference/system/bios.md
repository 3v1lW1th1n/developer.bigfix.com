{% type smbios value%}

Information about the SMBIOS (System Management BIOS) is contained in a set of data values stored in collections of individual smbios structures.

{% property <smbios value> as string %}

Casts a smbios value as a string type.

{% property type of <smbios value> %}

Returns the data type of the specified smbios value. This can be one of:ByteWordDwordQwordStringBinaryStringMultipleString.

{% property structure of <smbios value> %}

Returns the parent smbios structure(s) containing the specified value.Example: names of structures of values &quot;bios_version&quot; of structures of smbios - Returns the names of the smbios structures that contain the specified value, in this case the named value &#39;bios version&#39;.

{% property offset of <smbios value> %}

Returns the offset position relative to the start of the given smbios value in its smbios structure. For more information about these offsets, see the SMBIOS specification.

{% property name of <smbios value> %}

Returns the name(s) of the specified smbios values, typically as derived from a smbios structure.

{% type smbios structure%}

The SMBIOS (System Management BIOS) is composed of a set of named structures, such as processor_information, bios_information, and more.

{% property value of <smbios structure> %}

Returns the element of the given smbios structure that contains information specific to the particular machine. Values can have integer or string data. There can be multiple value entries with the same name, so values are implemented as iterated and named iterated properties of the smbios structure.

{% property value <string> of <smbios structure> %}

Returns the named value of the specified smbios structure.

{% property type of <smbios structure> %}

Returns the type of the smbios structure (as an integer) defined in the SMBIOS specification.

{% property string value <string> of <smbios structure> %}

Returns the string value corresponding to the specified value of the smbios structure. This only exists for those values whose data type is string.

{% property string <string> of <smbios structure> %}

Returns the named value in the specified smbios structure.

{% property name of <smbios structure> %}

Returns a string containing the name of the specified smbios structure as derived from the &#39;Type&#39; entry in the SMBIOS specification. To create a valid Relevance keyword, some rules are applied to the name: Spaces are replaced with underscoresParenthesized sections are deletedLeading and trailing whitespace is removedUppercase is transformed to lowercaseKeywords beginning with a number have a &#39;b&#39; prepended.

{% property length of <smbios structure> %}

Returns the length of the smbios structure as defined in the SMBIOS specification.

{% property integer value <string> of <smbios structure> %}

Returns the integer value corresponding to the specified value of the smbios structure. This only exists for those values whose data type is integer.

{% property integer <string> of <smbios structure> %}

Returns the integer data of the named value in a specified smbios structure. Returns NSO if the data type is not integer.

{% type smbios%}

The SMBIOS (System Management BIOS) is a database containing information about the system hardware and firmware. It consists of a series of structures that each contain a logical grouping of basic system information such as processor, baseboard, memory, ports, slots, and more. Each structure, in turn, contains specific named values that can be interrogated. For instance, you easily access information about the client processor chip, including the manufacturer, speed and more by accessing the desired value of the &#39;processor information&#39; structure. These SMBIOS inspectors are based on DMTF Standard version 2.6.1. For a complete listing of the SMBIOS structures and the strings used to query them, refer to the SMBIOS inspectors in the Resources section at the end of this guide.

{% property structure of <smbios> %}

A property containing information pertaining to an instance of a given smbios structure as defined in the &#39;Type&#39; entries in the SMBIOS specification. This is implemented as a named iterated property.

{% property structure <string> of <smbios> %}

Returns the smbios structure corresponding to the specified string as defined in the &#39;Type&#39; entries in the SMBIOS specification.

{% type bios%}

On Windows computers, this object returns strings that identify the version of the BIOS. On other computers, all bios expressions will fail gracefully, rather than generating an error.

{% property <bios> as string %}

This Windows-only inspector returns a string that is the concatenation of the BIOS name and date. On a non-Windows operating system, it returns FALSE.

{% property version of <bios> %}

This Windows-only inspector returns the first string of the multi-string version stored in the bios. This string may not exist. The format depends upon your BIOS manufacturer. On a non-Windows operating system, it returns FALSE.

{% property date of <bios> %}

This Windows-only inspector returns the date string stored in the bios. This string is formatted as MM/DD/YY. On a non-Windows operating system, it returns FALSE.

{% property version string of <bios> %}

No documentation exists for this property.
