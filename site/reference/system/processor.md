{% type processor%}

The &lt;processor&gt; object is used to identify the number and properties of processors in the system. You can identify the manufacturer of the CPU as well as the speed and other features. Many operating systems provide for multiple processors. You can inspect any one of them by their ordinal number.For more information on Windows processors, see the Resource section at the end of this guide.

{% property unique value of <hertz> %}

Returns the unique values of a given list of &lt;hertz&gt; types, removing duplicates and sorting by value.
