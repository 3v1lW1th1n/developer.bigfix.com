{% type runlevel %}

The &lt;runlevel&gt; inspectors refer to a mode of operation in various Unix systems. Typically, when a computer enters runlevel zero, it halts and when it enters runlevel six, it reboots. The intermediate runlevels differ widely among operating systems.

#### Properties of runlevel

Returns the time at which the runlevel was set to its current value.

{% property value of <runlevel> %}
