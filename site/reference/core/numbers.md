{% type integer with multiplicity%}

The &lt;integer with multiplicity&gt; inspectors deal with arrays of integers, allowing you to extract unique numbers and count them. 

{% property multiplicity of <integer with multiplicity> %}

{% type integer set%}

The &lt;integer set&gt; inspectors deal with sets of integers, which are essentially lists or arrays with integer elements. Think of them as mathematical sets: you can compare them, subtract them from other sets and form the union and intersection of multiple sets.Note: These inspectors are not available on SUSE Linux systems.

{% type floating point%}

The &lt;floating point&gt; type holds a floating-point number, with precision dependent on the computer. It also keeps track of the IEEE floating-point exceptions raised in a calculation and an estimate of the significance with which the number should be expressed when it is converted to a string. All arithmetic operations are carried out to the full precision of the computer; only conversions to string are affected by the estimated significance.

{% property <floating point> as string %}

{% property invalid of <floating point> %}

Returns TRUE if the calculation raised the invalid exception; that is, if some part of the calculation a function was applied to a value outside its domain.

{% property integer floor of <floating point> %}
