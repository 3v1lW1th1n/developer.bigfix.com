{% type debian base package %}

For Tivoli inspectors, a Debian package is considered to include both the package and the version. This allows the inspectors to home in on specific versioned packages and not just the package itself, which may have numerous versions. The base package inspectors help to tease these two aspects apart, stripping the version info and returning a list of the packages by name only.

#### Properties of debian base package

{% property currently installed of <debian base package> %}

Returns TRUE if the specified Debian base package is currently installed.

{% property installed version of <debian base package> %}

Returns the currently installed debianpkg version of the specified Debian base package.

#### Casts of debian package upstream version

{% cast <debian package upstream version> as debian package version upstream %}

This is a reflexive casting for the sake of completeness. Note: upstream version is treated the same as version upstream.

Returns a list of the unique values (along with their frequency count) as extracted from the specified list of debian package upstream versions.

{% type debian package version %}

For Tivoli inspectors, a Debian package is considered to include both the package and the version. This allows the inspectors to home in on specific versioned packages and not just the package itself, which may have numerous versions. These version inspectors return just the version(s) of a given Debian package. A version is composed of three parts: an epoch, an upstream_version and a debian_revision.

{% type debian package version epoch %}

The &lt;debian package version epoch&gt; inspectors deal with the &#39;epoch&#39; component of a Debian package version. The epoch is an unsigned integer, typically a small number. If it is omitted,  zero is the default. It allows the package provider to create a fresh start with version numbering schemes.

{% type debian package version revision %}

Also known as the &#39;debian_revision&#39;, these inspectors reveal the revision of a Debian package based on the upstream_version. The revision component of the version is optional. Typically, the revision is set to 1 whenever the upstream_version is increased.
