{% type short rpm package version record with multiplicity%}

The &lt;short rpm package version record with multiplicity&gt; inspectors deal with arrays of short RPM package version records, allowing you to extract unique records and count them. 

{% property multiplicity of <short rpm package version record with multiplicity> %}

Sorts the list and returns the multiplicity, or count, of each unique element in the specified list of multiple &lt;short rpm package version record&gt; types.

{% type short rpm package version record%}

This is the same as an RPM package version record, except that the epoch (if one exists) is not shown when converted to a string. However, even though it isn&#39;t displayed, the epoch is still retained. If you need to remove the epoch, use one of the &#39;no epoch&#39; inspectors.

{% property <short rpm package version record> as string %}

Returns the integer Epoch (which grants RPM more flexibility in versioning) of the specified RPM Package version record.

{% type rpm package version%}

The &lt;rpm package version&gt; inspectors disclose properties of the RPM package version record inspector. They are collected from the &#39;Version&#39; component of the Epoch, Version and Release fields associated with an RPM package. The behavior of this inspector differs from a string, because they are sorted according to RPM rules defined by the rpmvercmp() function of the RPM library. Don&#39;t create an &lt;rpm package release&gt; inspector with embedded &#39;-&#39; or whitespace characters. These characters are disallowed in RPM, and will cause the statement to fail. Note: Requires the presence of the RPM library and librpminfo (an open source library created by BigFix containing modified RPM library code) on the client machine. librpminfo is installed on the client as part of the normal BES client RPM installation procedure.

They are collected from the &#39;Release&#39; component of the Epoch, Version and Release fields associated with an RPM package. The behavior of this inspector differs from a string, because they are sorted according to RPM rules defined by the rpmvercmp() function of the RPM library. Don&#39;t create an &lt;rpm package release&gt; inspector with embedded &#39;-&#39; or whitespace characters. These characters are disallowed in RPM, and will cause the statement to fail.

{% type capability%}

A package can have capabilities that it requires, provides, obsoletes, or conflicts with. For instance, apache may require sh, and provide httpd.
