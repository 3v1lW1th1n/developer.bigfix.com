# string position

String position works in combination with the string and substring data types. A string position is a point within a string. It can be compared to an integer (which it is derived from), but it also acts as a pointer within a string so that the preceding and following text can be extracted.

# following text of [string position]

Returns the substring following the position in the string. For example, following text of position 5 of &quot;0123456789&quot; = &quot;567890&quot;.

# preceding text of [string position]

Returns the substring preceding the position in the string. For example, preceding text of position 5 of &quot;0123456789&quot; = &quot;01234&quot;.
