The Security database and its properties expose the NetUserModalsGet API, levels 0 and 3. For more information, see the NetUserModalsGet Function at the MSDN site: http://msdn.microsoft.com.",
    "audit policy": "The <audit policy> inspectors return the policies put in place for recording information about security-related operations on the client computer. For example, you can set a policy to monitor the modification of files. This will trigger an audit entry showing whenever a file is modified, the associated user account, and the date and time of the action. You can audit both successful and failed attempts at actions. Often, the failed attempts are more interesting, as they may indicate attempts to unsuccessfully subvert a policy. For instance, a successful login is not as interesting as a repeated failure might be.",
    "audit policy category": "Windows audit policies, as of Vista and later, are divided into categories. Currently there are 9 categories, including System, Logon/Logoff, Object Access, Privilege Use, Detailed Tracking, Policy Change, Account Management, DS Access and Account Logon.",

    "application usage summary": "To enable the <application usage summary> inspectors, you first need to create the client setting _BESClient_UsageManager_EnableAppUsageSummary and initialize it to 1. You must also configure the set of applications to monitor by creating the client setting _BESClient_UsageManager_EnableAppUsageSummaryApps and initializing it to a list of apps to include (or exclude). The value of this setting should look like +:app1:app2:app3: to add apps to the scope, and -:app1:app2: to exclude apps. The case is ignored.

    "file": "For each file in the file system, you can create a corresponding file object and inspect its properties. inspectors are also provided to look at version data of executable files.Note: File systems that do not maintain the creation or last accessed times will often return the last modification time when queried for the creation or last accessed times or files. Modification times are preserved when files are copied. Thus, it is not uncommon to see a file that appears to have been modified before it was created.",
    "application": "Application objects derive from file objects. Therefore, application objects inherit all of the properties of the file object. This means that you can inspect properties such as 'modification time' or 'Product Version' of an application just as you would a file. See the properties of a file object for a complete list of these. The real power and primary purpose of the application object is their creation. The creation methods are optimized in anticipation of the importance of this object.Note: See  File' for a list of the Application properties. Folder and file names may be case sensitive. Use \"as uppercase\" or \"as lowercase\" if you don't know the actual case when making comparisons. For Windows versions of these inspectors, a properly installed application will register itself with the operating system. It does this by creating a registry sub-key usually named after the executable. The regapp inspector uses the default value of this sub-key as a string that is the full pathname of the executable. ",
    "folder": "For every folder that exists in the file system, you can create a folder object. These inspectors allow you to examine dozens of properties of folder objects.

There are many properties that symlinks have in common with files, such as name, pathname, parent folder, and more. In addition, a symlink has a value corresponding to the file object it points to. You can also determine if the file is available or not.",
    "logical volume manager": "On AIX, the logical volume manager provides a flexible means of allocating disk space using volume groups, logical volumes, and physical volumes. A volume group is a collection of one or more physical volumes and a logical volume is an abstraction representing a pool of disk space. The disk space assigned to a logical volume appears contiguous to the user, but it may actually be distributed across one or more physical volumes within a single volume group.",
    "logical volume": "A logical volume consists of an array of identically sized logical partitions. The partition size of a logical volume is determined by the volume group that contains it, and is the same as the volume group's physical partition size. Contiguous logical partitions within a logical volume may map to discontiguous physical partitions, possibly distributed across multiple physical volumes. A logical volume may be configured so that its logical partitions are mirrored to protect data from hardware failures. Mirroring may be configured so that each logical partition maps to either 2 or 3 physical partition mirrors.",
    "volume group": "On AIX systems, physical disk volumes are organized into volume groups. The partition size of a physical volume is determined by the volume group that it belongs to. If multiple physical volumes belong to the same volume group, then they must all have the same partition size. A typical partition size might be 16 or 32 megabytes.",
